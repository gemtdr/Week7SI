My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. 
The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we are descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch,
but the actual founder of my line was the brother of my grandfather, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to
the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day. (edited)
